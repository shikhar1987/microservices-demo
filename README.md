**Online Boutique** is a cloud-first microservices demo application.  The application is a
web-based e-commerce app where users can browse items, add them to the cart, and purchase them.

Google uses this application to demonstrate how developers can modernize enterprise applications using Google Cloud products, including: [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine), [Cloud Service Mesh (CSM)](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh), [gRPC](https://grpc.io/), [Cloud Operations](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations), [Spanner](https://cloud.google.com/spanner), [Memorystore](https://cloud.google.com/memorystore), [AlloyDB](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb), and [Gemini](https://ai.google.dev/). This application works on any Kubernetes cluster.

**We'll be using this to demonstrate capabilities of Splunk Observability Cloud offerings. You can choose any of the deployment options mentioned below**

## Deploy Online Boutique variations with Kustomize

The [`/kustomize` folder](/kustomize) contains instructions for customizing the deployment of Online Boutique with different variations such as:

- integrating with [Google Cloud Operations](/kustomize/components/google-cloud-operations/)
- replacing the in-cluster Redis cache with [Google Cloud Memorystore (Redis)](/kustomize/components/memorystore), [AlloyDB](/kustomize/components/alloydb) or [Google Cloud Spanner](/kustomize/components/spanner)
- etc.

## Architecture

**Online Boutique** is composed of 11 microservices written in different
languages that talk to each other over gRPC.

## Features

- **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io)/[GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/):**
  The app is designed to run on Kubernetes (both locally on "Docker for
  Desktop", as well as on the cloud with GKE).
- **[gRPC](https://grpc.io):** Microservices use a high volume of gRPC calls to
  communicate to each other.
- **[Istio](https://istio.io):** Application works on Istio service mesh.
- **[Cloud Operations (Stackdriver)](https://cloud.google.com/products/operations):** Many services
  are instrumented with **Profiling** and **Tracing**. In
  addition to these, using Istio enables features like Request/Response
  **Metrics** and **Context Graph** out of the box. When it is running out of
  Google Cloud, this code path remains inactive.
- **[Skaffold](https://skaffold.dev):** Application
  is deployed to Kubernetes with a single command using Skaffold.
- **Synthetic Load Generation:** The application demo comes with a background
  job that creates realistic usage patterns on the website using
  [Locust](https://locust.io/) load generator.
